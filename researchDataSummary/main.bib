    abstract  = {Polymorphisms allowing multiple structural phases are among the most fascinating properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Herein{,} the polymorphic 1T' phase and its lattice dynamics for bilayer VSe2 grown on epitaxial bilayer graphene are investigated via low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The 1T' structure{,} mostly observed in group-6 TMDs{,} is unexpected in VSe2{,} which is a group-5 TMD. Emergence of the 1T' structure in bilayer VSe2 suggests the important roles of interface and layer configurations{,} providing new possibilities regarding the polymorphism of TMDs. Detailed topographical analysis elucidates the microscopic nature of the 1T' structure{,} confirming that Se-like and V-like surfaces can be resolved depending on the polarity of the sample bias. In addition{,} bilayer VSe2 can transit from a static state of the 1T' phase to a dynamic state consisting of lattice vibrations{,} triggered by tunneling current from the STM tip. Topography also shows hysteretic behavior during the staticâ€“dynamic transition{,} which is attributed to latent energy existing between the two states. The observed lattice dynamics involve vibrational motion of the Se atoms and the middle V atoms. Our observations will provide important information to establish in-depth understanding of the microscopic nature of 1T' structures and the polymorphism of two-dimensional TMDs.}

    abstract = {Abstract Among van der Waals layered ferromagnets, monolayer vanadium diselenide (VSe2) stands out due to its robust ferromagnetism. However, the exfoliation of monolayer VSe2 is challenging, not least because the monolayer flake is extremely unstable in air. Using an electrochemical exfoliation approach with organic cations as the intercalants, monolayer 1T-VSe2 flakes are successfully obtained from the bulk crystal at high yield. Thiol molecules are further introduced onto the VSe2 surface to passivate the exfoliated flakes, which improves the air stability of the flakes for subsequent characterizations. Room-temperature ferromagnetism is confirmed on the exfoliated 2D VSe2 flakes using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and magnetic force microscopy (MFM), where the monolayer flake displays the strongest ferromagnetic properties. Se vacancies, which can be ubiquitous in such materials, also contribute to the ferromagnetism of VSe2, although density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that such effect can be minimized by physisorbed oxygen molecules or covalently bound thiol molecules.},

    abstract  = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides with van der Waals gaps have attracted much attention due to their peculiarly distinctive physical properties from their bulk counterparts. Among them{,} vanadium diselenide (VSe2) has been considered to be a promising candidate for future spintronic devices{,} as room temperature ferromagnetism was reported recently. However{,} detailed crystallography and properties of VSe2 nanosheets have been less explored. Here{,} we report the atomistic real-space observation of the van der Waals layered structure of VSe2 for the first time. Furthermore{,} simply by controlling the carrier gas flow rate{,} a morphological variation of the surface area and thickness of VSe2 nanosheets was observed. The room temperature ferromagnetic feature of single VSe2 nanosheets was also revealed by magnetic force microscopy measurements. Our findings will play a significant role in the research of intrinsic 2D ferromagnetic materials.}

    abstract  = {Isolating single unit-cell thin layers from the bulk matrix of layered compounds offers tremendous opportunities to design novel functional electronic materials. However, a comprehensive thickness dependence study is paramount to harness the electronic properties of such atomic foils and their stacking into synthetic heterostructures. Here we show that a dimensional crossover and quantum confinement with reducing thickness result in a striking non-monotonic evolution of the charge density wave transition temperature in VSe2. Our conclusion is drawn from a direct derivation of the local order parameter and transition temperature from the real space charge modulation amplitude imaged by scanning tunnelling microscopy. This study lifts the disagreement of previous independent transport measurements. We find that thickness can be a non-trivial tuning parameter and demonstrate the importance of considering a finite thickness range to accurately characterize its influence.}
