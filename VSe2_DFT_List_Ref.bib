abstract = {Abstract Among van der Waals layered ferromagnets, monolayer vanadium diselenide (VSe2) stands out due to its robust ferromagnetism. However, the exfoliation of monolayer VSe2 is challenging, not least because the monolayer flake is extremely unstable in air. Using an electrochemical exfoliation approach with organic cations as the intercalants, monolayer 1T-VSe2 flakes are successfully obtained from the bulk crystal at high yield. Thiol molecules are further introduced onto the VSe2 surface to passivate the exfoliated flakes, which improves the air stability of the flakes for subsequent characterizations. Room-temperature ferromagnetism is confirmed on the exfoliated 2D VSe2 flakes using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and magnetic force microscopy (MFM), where the monolayer flake displays the strongest ferromagnetic properties. Se vacancies, which can be ubiquitous in such materials, also contribute to the ferromagnetism of VSe2, although density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that such effect can be minimized by physisorbed oxygen molecules or covalently bound thiol molecules.},

	abstract = {To understand the magnetism of VSe2, whose monolayer form has recently been reported to be a room temperature ferromagnet, here, the combined method of conventional density functional theory with dynamical mean-field theory has been adopted. This higher-level computation method enables us to resolve many of existing controversies and contradictions in between theory and experiment. First of all, this new approach is shown to give the correct magnetic properties of both bulk and two-dimensional limit of VSe2 which demonstrates its superiority to the conventional methods. The results demonstrate that monolayer VSe2 without charge density waves is a ferromagnet with ordering temperature of 250 K. From the direct simulation of temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility and ordered moment, it is shown that its ferromagnetism is clearly two-dimensional in nature. Further, it is shown that this ferromagnetic order is vulnerable to extra charge dopings which provides the important insight to elucidate recent experimental controversies.}

abstract = "By adopting the first-principles methods based on the density functional theory, we studied the electronic and magnetic properties of group-V MX2 (M = V, Nb, Ta; X = S, Se, Te) monolayers with atomic-sized structural defects. We firstly studied the two phases of 1H and 1T. It shows that the formation energies of the 1T phase are lower compared with those of the 1H phase for VSe2 and VTe2. For the rest MX2, the formation energies of the 1H phase are lower. Our results indicate that all the 1H and 1T phases of MX2 are metal except for 1H-VSe2 and 1H-VTe2 which are semiconducting. For monolayers MX2 with atomic-sized defects, our calculations predict that the diatomic X atoms vacancies of VX-X and V2X both cause the metal–semiconductor transition, and vacancies of VM and VX-X, as well as anti-site defect of MX induce semiconductor–metal transition. Meanwhile, the total magnetic moments of the 1H and 1T phases of VX2 increase with inducing the X atom vacancies including VX, VX-X and V2X. Additionally, VX vacancy and V2X vacancy bring magnetism into the 1T-TaSe2 and 1T-TaS2, respectively."

abstract  ="First principles calculations of the magnetic and electronic properties of VSe2 describing the transition between two structural phases (H{,}T) were performed. The results of the calculations evidence a rather low energy barrier (0.60 eV for the monolayer) for the transition between the phases. The energy required for the deviation of a Se atom or whole layer of selenium atoms by a small angle of up to 10° from their initial positions is also rather low{,} 0.32 and 0.19 eV/Se{,} respectively. The changes in the band structure of VSe2 caused by these motions of Se atoms should be taken into account for analysis of the experimental data. Simulations of the strain effects suggest that the experimentally observed T phase of the VSe2 monolayer is the ground state due to substrate-induced strain. Calculations of the difference in the total energies of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations evidence that the ferromagnetic configuration is the ground state of the system for all stable and intermediate atomic structures. Calculated phonon dispersions suggest a visible influence of the magnetic configurations on the vibrational properties."}
