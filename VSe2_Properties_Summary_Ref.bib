abstract={There has been enormous recent interest in heterostructures of two-dimensional van der Waals materials. Integrating materials with different quantum ground states in vertical heterostructures is predicted to lead to novel electronic properties that are not found in the constituent layers. Here, we present direct synthesis of a superconductor-magnet hybrid heterostructure by combining superconducting niobium diselenide (NbSe2) with the monolayer vanadium diselenide (VSe2). Molecular-beam epitaxy growth in ultra-high vacuum yields clean and atomically sharp interfaces. Combining different characterization techniques and density-functional theory calculations, we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of VSe2 on NbSe2. Low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy measurements show an absence of the typical charge density wave on VSe2 and demonstrate a reduction of the superconducting gap of NbSe2 on the VSe2 layer. This suggests magnetization of the VSe2 sheet, at least on the local scale. Our work demonstrates superconducting-magnetic hybrid materials with potential applications in future electronics devices.},

abstract={Reduced dimensionality and interlayer coupling in van der Waals materials gives rise to fundamentally different electronic1, optical2and many-body quantum3--5 properties in monolayers compared with the bulk. This layer-dependence permits the discovery of novel material properties in the monolayer regime. Ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional materials is a coveted property that would allow fundamental studies of spin behaviour in low dimensions and enable new spintronics applications6--8. Recent studies have shown that for the bulk-ferromagnetic layered materials CrI3 (ref. 9) and Cr2Ge2Te6 (ref. 10), ferromagnetic order is maintained down to the ultrathin limit at low temperatures. Contrary to these observations, we report the emergence of strong ferromagnetic ordering for monolayer VSe2, a material that is paramagnetic in the bulk11,12. Importantly, the ferromagnetic ordering with a large magnetic moment persists to above room temperature, making VSe2 an attractive material for van der Waals spintronics applications.},
