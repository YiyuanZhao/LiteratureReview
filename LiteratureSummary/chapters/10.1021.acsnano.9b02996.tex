\section{Abstract}
Magnetism in monolayer (ML) VSe2 has attracted broad interest in spintronics, while existing reports have not reached consensus. Using element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, a magnetic transition in ML VSe2 has been demonstrated at the contamination-free interface between Co and VSe2. Through interfacial hybridization with a Co atomic overlayer, a magnetic moment of about 0.4 $\mu_B$ per V atom in ML VSe2 is revealed, approaching values predicted by previous theoretical calculations. Promotion of the ferromagnetism in ML VSe2 is accompanied by its antiferromagnetic coupling to Co and a reduction in the spin moment of Co. In comparison to the absence of this interface-induced ferromagnetism at the Fe/ML MoSe2 interface, these findings at the Co/ML VSe2 interface provide clear proof that the ML VSe2, initially with magnetic disorder, is on the verge of magnetic transition.

\section{Background}
% \labsec{sec:Background}
Bonilla et al. indicated that a ferromagnetic state persists up to room temperature in ML VSe2, but their report has several critical unexplained features. Their most debatable finding is the reported magnetization of $15 \mu_B$ per V atom, which disagrees with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations for ML VSe2.

Subsequently, we obtained the \textbf{first experimental evidence of spin frustration in ML VSe2}, which leads to a highly degenerate ground state and forbids magnetic ordering. Although lacking long-range magnetic order in such a frustrated magnet, perturbations that break the symmetry of the lattice could possibly break the ground-state degeneracy and lead to magnetic order.

Step height is ~7 A. XA spectroscopy at the V $L_{2,3}$ edge shows in \reffig{10.1021.acsnano.9b02996_STMTopographyOfMLVSe2}b. These spectral features are akin to those measured from other $3d^1$ vanadium compounds, thus providing a spectroscopic fingerprint of the \textbf{1T phase of the monolayer}. XMCD measurement at the V $L_{2,3}$ edge shows in \reffig{10.1021.acsnano.9b02996_STMTopographyOfMLVSe2}c. The XMCD contrast, within the scale of experimental error, is negligible and thus \textbf{rules out the existence of intrinsic ferromagnetism in the monolayer}, which demonstrating ML VSe2 as a frustrated magnet, in which its spins exhibit subtle correlations albeit in the absence of a long-range magnetic order.

As shown in \reffig{10.1021.acsnano.9b02996_MicroscopicMagneticMoments}, the orbital moment of V, mL,V, carries the opposite sign as the spin moment, mS,V, in agreement with Hundâ€™s rule for a less than half-filled 3d shell. Moreover, the resulting total moment of V, mtot,$V = m_{L,V} + m_{S,V}$, has an opposite sign to that of Co (mtot,Co), confirming an antiferromagnetic coupling between Co and ML VSe2.
