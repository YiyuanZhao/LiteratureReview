    abstract  = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides with van der Waals gaps have attracted much attention due to their peculiarly distinctive physical properties from their bulk counterparts. Among them{,} vanadium diselenide (VSe2) has been considered to be a promising candidate for future spintronic devices{,} as room temperature ferromagnetism was reported recently. However{,} detailed crystallography and properties of VSe2 nanosheets have been less explored. Here{,} we report the atomistic real-space observation of the van der Waals layered structure of VSe2 for the first time. Furthermore{,} simply by controlling the carrier gas flow rate{,} a morphological variation of the surface area and thickness of VSe2 nanosheets was observed. The room temperature ferromagnetic feature of single VSe2 nanosheets was also revealed by magnetic force microscopy measurements. Our findings will play a significant role in the research of intrinsic 2D ferromagnetic materials.}

    abstract  = {First principles calculations of the magnetic and electronic properties of VSe2 describing the transition between two structural phases (H{,}T) were performed. The results of the calculations evidence a rather low energy barrier (0.60 eV for the monolayer) for the transition between the phases. The energy required for the deviation of a Se atom or whole layer of selenium atoms by a small angle of up to 10° from their initial positions is also rather low{,} 0.32 and 0.19 eV/Se{,} respectively. The changes in the band structure of VSe2 caused by these motions of Se atoms should be taken into account for analysis of the experimental data. Simulations of the strain effects suggest that the experimentally observed T phase of the VSe2 monolayer is the ground state due to substrate-induced strain. Calculations of the difference in the total energies of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations evidence that the ferromagnetic configuration is the ground state of the system for all stable and intermediate atomic structures. Calculated phonon dispersions suggest a visible influence of the magnetic configurations on the vibrational properties.}
